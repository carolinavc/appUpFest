# App UpFest

**A Web Development Project for UpFest - Bringing Music Festivals to the Digital World**

---

## Overview

App UpFest is a web development project undertaken to complete the frontend of the UpFest event management application. The task was initiated after a previous frontend specialist abandoned the project, leaving it unfinished. The aim is to implement a set of web pages based on provided designs, enhancing user experience, and preparing the platform for investment.

## Key Features

- Browse and explore a catalog of upcoming music festivals.
- Access detailed festival information, including event titles, dates, concerts, and ticket pricing.
- Dive into artist biographies and discover their upcoming concerts.
- Seamlessly purchase festival tickets through Multibanco references.
- Enable in-event purchases via a preloaded balance system (cashless).

## Objective

Our mission with the App UpFest project is to deliver a visually appealing and user-friendly frontend for the UpFest application. We aim to closely match the design mockups provided and follow industry best practices to ensure flexibility and maintainable code. Our focus is on implementing the following key pages:

- **Home Page**: A welcoming entry point, showcasing the current event the user is registered for and suggesting other upcoming events.

- **Festival Details Page**: Offering in-depth information about a selected festival, including schedules, artists, and ticket prices.

- **Personal Page**: Providing a personalized space for users to view their favorites and manage payments.

## Project Execution

- **Team**: This project is an individual effort, allowing each team member to demonstrate their web development skills.

- **Languages**: HTML and CSS (generated from SCSS) are used for the project's frontend.

- **Responsive Design**: Efforts are made to ensure the pages adapt gracefully to various screen sizes and devices.
